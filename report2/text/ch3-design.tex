\section{Introduction}

\section{Aims and Objectives}
\subsection{Aims}

The primary aim of this project is to explore methods for text generation and then develop a system through which prose about movies can be generated. This prose should be in the form of a movie review, and should pick the most recurrent points or themes in a corpus of movie reviews discussing a singular movie.

\subsection{Objectives}

To develop a natural language generation system which picks points from multiple review texts and uses them to structure an informed review.\\
To develop an online platform to host generated movie reviews which can gather feedback and data on the reception of said review.\\
To develop an autonomous bot that can discuss movies (or at least reply with an opinion of a movie) over twitter. Ideally this would drive traffic towards the movie review blog which hosts reviews made by the bot.
