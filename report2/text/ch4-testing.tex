\section{Introduction}
Testing each part of this system involves checking primarily that outputs are what they should be, but also checking that the data scraped from the internet is handled correctly in edge-cases and that errors are handled correctly and not ignored or allowed to halt the program code. Because of this, I have to create my own example data that looks like what is gathered from web scraping and API calls which mirror edge-cases.

\section{Movie Review Generation}
\subsection{Testing of Review Generation}
This involved a lot of testing of individual modules and functions to make sure that they handle all the data passed in to them. As the completed system merely takes an input which is the name of a film and several on/off parameters, there is not much in the user space that can change with regards to testing.

Most of this testing work is making sure that the SQL CRUD functions work, and making sure that the website displays the information that is intended, and checking that my information gathering here is accurate.

\subsection{Testing of Turing-Like Test Website}
This mostly involved checking that data entry performed correctly.
