This project investigates methodologies for generating movie review texts. It provides implementations and evaluation of several systems designed to generate review text for a given film. Several approaches have been taken towards generating these texts - a system based on Markov Models, a template based system, and a Natural Language Generation approach to producing the texts. In order to evaluate these systems, a bot for Twitter has been created, alongside two database-backed PHP websites. One posting reviews under the pretence of being written by a real human, and one for running a comparative test.
